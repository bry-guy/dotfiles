- [x] longer `history` output (e.g., history | grep <old-command-here> should work)
- [x] up-arrow scrolls back through history, but filters based on input (e.g., $ tmux should show old tmux commands)
- [x] debug vim slow startup
- [x] fix slow esc from insert-mode in vim (it was tmux)
- [x] fix broken copy/paste in alacritty
  - this is all fucked up. super c/v are copy/paste in alacritty. ctrl c/v are copy/paste everywhere else. I'll revisit this one day, maybe.
- [x] add indication of vim mode in zsh prompt
- [x] add basename of git repo to zsh prompt
- [ ] only include set -x output in dotfiles log file
- [ ] fix ctrl+c prompt
- [ ] figure out how to use `jdtls` easily and where to install it
