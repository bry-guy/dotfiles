## Pop-Tweaks

Git repos:
- [acdcontrol](https://acdcontrol.sourceforge.net): Apple Cinema Display Controls Utility for Linux, use f keys to control things
- [nvidia-patch](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch): Sunshine setup, should enable better video                           
- [xone](https://github.com/medusalix/xone): Xbox One driver for xbox controllers on linux

I deleted the git repos from these in this repo because I didn't want to remember to deal with submodules in the future. Good luck, future bryan.
