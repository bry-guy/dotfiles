# Full Feature Implementation Workflow

**FEATURE REQUEST:** $ARGUMENTS

**VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**
* Feature description must be minimum 10 characters
* Arguments cannot contain dangerous file path characters (../../, ~/, etc.)
* If $ARGUMENTS is empty or invalid, respond: 'Please provide a clear feature description (minimum 10 characters)'
* Validation must complete successfully before proceeding to decomposition

**Initial Task for Orchestration:**
The user is requesting the feature described by: "$ARGUMENTS".

You are the `BuildOrchestrator`. Initiate the workflow by:
1.  **Planning:** Decompose this request into a sequential list of non-conflicting **Micro-Tasks** (e.g., 3 to 5 steps maximum).
2.  **Presentation:** Present the Micro-Task list to the user for confirmation before proceeding to delegation.

Wait for user approval before delegating the first task to the `@build-worker`.
